### **3D Modeling & Industrial Design**: 
#### - Creation of detailed 3D CAD models optimized for assembly, manufacturability, and performance under defined operating conditions.

#### - Development of ergonomic, user-centric product designs focused on form, fit, function, and branding.

#### - Production of high-quality renderings and visualizations to support design reviews, stakeholder presentations, and marketing efforts.

### **2D Drawings & Technical Documentation**:
#### - Creation of ISO GPS/ASME Y14.5-compliant 2D CAD drawings with full tolerancing, surface finishes, and GD&T, along with production and user manuals for manufacturing and end-use support.

### **CAE Simulations & Tolerance Analysis**: 
#### - Execution of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to assess mechanical strength, stiffness, thermal behavior, and deformation under various load and boundary conditions-minimizing prototyping risks.

#### - Implementation of detailed tolerance analysis through Worst Case (WCA), Root Sum Square (RSS), and Monte Carlo (MC) methods to ensure assembly functionality under real-world manufacturing variations.

### **Rapid Prototyping & Demonstration Models**: 
#### - Fast and efficient fabrication of physical prototypes via 3D printing, CNC machining, and other rapid manufacturing techniques, serving as Proof-of-Concept models for early validation, functional testing, and investor demonstrations.

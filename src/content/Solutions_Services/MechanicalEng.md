### **3D CAD Design & Modeling**: 
#### - Creation of detailed and manufacturable 3D models using advanced CAD software, tailored to meet functional and aesthetic requirements
#### - Designs are optimized for assembly, manufacturability, and performance in real-world conditions

### **2D Technical Drawings**:
#### - Generation of precise and standardized 2D drawings, fully compliant with ISO GPS or ASME Y14.5 standards. These drawings include all necessary dimensional tolerances, surface finishes, and geometric controls to ensure accurate communication with manufacturing partners.

### **CAE Simulations (FEM/FEA)**: 
#### - Execution of computer-aided engineering simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) or Analysis (FEA). These simulations help validate mechanical strength, stiffness, thermal behavior, and deformation under various load and boundary conditions, reducing the risk of physical prototyping errors.

### **Tolerance Analysis**: 
#### - Detailed evaluation of dimensional tolerances through methods such as Worst Case Analysis (WCA), Root Sum Square (RSS), and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. This ensures that assemblies remain functional and manufacturable within real-world production variances.

### **Industrial Design & Visualization**:
#### - Development of ergonomic, user-centric product designs with an emphasis on form, function, and branding. 
#### - High-quality renderings and visualizations are produced to support design reviews, stakeholder presentations, and marketing initiatives.

### **Rapid Prototyping & Demonstration Models**: 
#### - Fast and efficient fabrication of physical prototypes using 3D printing, CNC machining, or other rapid manufacturing techniques. These models serve as proof-of-concept units or technological demonstrators for early-stage validation, functional testing, and investor showcases.

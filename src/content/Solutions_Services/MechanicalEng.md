### **3D Modeling & Industrial Design**: 
#### - Development of detailed 3D models and user-centric product designs, optimized for manufacturability and focused on fit, form and function.

#### - Creation of high-quality renderings and visualizations to support design reviews, stakeholder presentations, branding and marketing efforts.

### **2D Drawings & Technical Documentation**:
#### - Creation of ISO GPS / ASME Y14.5-compliant 2D CAD technical drawings with full tolerancing, surface finishes, and GD&T, along with production and user manuals for manufacturing and end-use support.

### **CAE Simulations & Tolerance Analysis**: 
#### - Finite Element Analysis (FEA) under various load and boundary conditions, minimizing prototyping risks and meeting required performance.

#### - Tolerance analysis using WCA, RSS, and Monte Carlo methods to ensure functionality under real-world manufacturing variations.

### **Rapid Prototyping & Demonstration Models**: 
#### - Fast fabrication and delivery of functional prototypes serving as Proof-of-Concept for early validation, functional testing and investor demonstrations.
